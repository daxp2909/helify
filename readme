# 🦵 Helify – Clinical Precision MVP  
**AI-powered Knee Extension Tracking (Web Demo)**

Live Demo:  
👉 https://daxp2909.github.io/helify/

Helify is a camera-based physiotherapy analysis system that uses AI pose detection to provide **real-time clinical feedback** for knee extension exercises.

This MVP is designed for **clinical demonstrations, stakeholder presentations, and technical validation** — not for patients.

---

## 🎯 What This Demo Shows

This MVP demonstrates how Helify can:

- Track the **left leg (hip → knee → ankle)**
- Measure **knee angle (ROM)**
- Detect:
  - **Valid repetitions**
  - **Exercise speed**
  - **Unsafe movement**
- Provide **live visual + numeric feedback**
- Store **up to 10 sessions locally**

All processing runs **entirely inside the browser** — no backend, no uploads, no cloud.

---

## 🖥️ How to Use (Demo Flow)

### 1️⃣ Setup
- Open on a **PC or laptop**
- Allow **camera access**
- Sit on a **flat surface or floor**
- Make sure your **left leg is fully visible**
  - Hip
  - Knee
  - Ankle

If the leg is not visible, the system will show:

⚠️ Please show your full Left Leg


---

### 2️⃣ Start Exercising
Perform slow knee extensions:

1. Start with your leg **straight**
2. Bend your knee downward
3. Return to a **fully straight** position

This full movement is counted as **one repetition**.

---

## 📊 What You See on Screen

| Metric | Meaning |
|------|--------|
| **Valid Reps** | Clinically accepted repetitions |
| **Angle** | Live knee angle in degrees |
| **Pace** | Time taken per rep |
| **Target Pace** | 2–4 seconds per rep |

---

## 🧠 How a Rep is Validated

Helify uses biomechanical rules.

### Range of Motion (ROM)

| Rule | Value |
|------|------|
| Start / End Position | ≥ 165° |
| Minimum Depth | ≤ 110° |
| Hyper-extension Warning | > 175° |

If the knee does not bend enough:


⚠️ Increase range


If the knee extends too far:


❗ Do not overextend


---

### Speed Rules

| Condition | Time |
|--------|------|
| Too Fast (momentum) | < 2.0 seconds |
| Ideal | 2.0 – 4.0 seconds |
| Too Slow | > 6.0 seconds |

Feedback examples:
- **Slow down**
- **Maintain steady pace**

---

## 🔔 Real-Time Feedback

Helify provides live guidance:

| Color | Meaning |
|------|--------|
| Cyan | Correct movement |
| Yellow | Warning |
| Red | Unsafe or invalid |

These appear as floating notifications while exercising.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

This is a **demonstration MVP**.

- Not a medical device  
- Not for unsupervised patient use  
- Designed for:
  - Clinical validation
  - Product demos
  - AI accuracy testing  

Camera angle, lighting, and clothing affect accuracy.

---

## 🔒 Privacy

- Video never leaves your device
- All processing runs in your browser
- Session data is stored using browser localStorage

---

## 🧪 Best Demo Conditions

For best performance:

- Bright, even lighting
- Plain background
- Camera at knee height
- Left leg fully visible
- Avoid loose clothing around the knee

---

## 🚀 Why This MVP Matters

This prototype proves that:

- Real-time AI physiotherapy tracking  
- Clinical ROM validation  
- Exercise quality feedback  

can run **entirely in a web browser** with no backend or app installation.

Helify is ready for **clinical pilots, investor demos, and product validation**.
